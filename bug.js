In React Router Dom v6, a common error occurs when using the `useNavigate` hook incorrectly within a functional component that's not directly rendered by a route.  The error message usually points to `useNavigate` being called outside a router context. This happens because `useNavigate` relies on the router's context to function.

Example of incorrect usage:
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ... other code ...
  navigate('/home');
  return <div>MyComponent</div>;
}

// MyComponent is not directly under a Route. It might be nested deep.
export default MyComponent;
```
